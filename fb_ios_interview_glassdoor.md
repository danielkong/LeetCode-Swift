Application
I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Facebook.

Interview
I got first connected by a recruiter who found my profile on Linkedin. The first was a phone screening that asked 5 really simple questions about iOS and Objective C (I think you have to score 3 out of 5 to pass this screening).

Then was a technical phone interview with a recruiter from Facebook. The interviewer picked the topic of memory management, and ARC. Also asked about KVC and KVO.â€¦

Interview Questions
1. Describe how memory is managed in iOS (with Objective C), and further more what does retain(), release() do in Objective C, and also how did ARC improved memory management.

2. Had a another coding challenge about view hierarchy in iOS. Was actually a question for using recursive calling to retrieve a node from a binary tree that was copied from another tree. Sorry couldn't quite recall the actual question.
