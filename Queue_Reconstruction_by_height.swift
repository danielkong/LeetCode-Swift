// 406. Queue Reconstruction by height    Medium
/**
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
*/

/**
Pick out tallest group of people and sort them in a subarray (S). Since there's no other groups of people taller than them, therefore each guy's index will be just as same as his k value.
For 2nd tallest group (and the rest), insert each one of them into (S) by k value. So on and so forth.
E.g.
input: [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
subarray after step 1: [[7,0], [7,1]]
subarray after step 2: [[7,0], [6,1], [7,1]]
...
